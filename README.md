## ✨ What is reShapr?

**reShapr** is the open source, no-code MCP Server for AI-Native API Access. It bridges the gap between traditional REST/GraphQL/gRPC services and LLMs by transforming complex services into discoverable, optimized MCP tools.

  <em>Transforming any API into lean LLM contexts in seconds.</em>

> To get involved with our community, please familiarize yourself with the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### 🧠 Solving the "Context Window" Problem

One of the biggest hurdles in building AI agents is **Context Overload**. Sending massive JSON responses to an LLM wastes tokens and degrades performance. 

[**reShapr introduces Context Control**](https://reshapr.io/blog/from-context-overload-to-context-control)

## 🌟 Key Features

* AI-Native Transformation: Auto-transform API services into LLM-friendly tools.
* Context Control: Filter and slim down payloads before they reach the LLM.
* Multi-Protocol: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC support.
* No-Code: Configure and deploy in minutes.

## Quick Start

### Install the CLI

```sh
npm install -g @reshapr/reshapr-cli
```

### Choose your platform

You have two simple options:
1. Use the [https://try.reshapr.io/](https://try.reshapr.io/) to try out the platform. Follow our detailed 
[Try reShapr online](https://reshapr.io/docs/tutorials/try-reshapr-online) guide.
2. Run the platform locally using [containers and Docker runtime](https://reshapr.io/docs/how-to-guides/docker-compose). Follow the next section for details.

### Run the platform locally

Assuming you have Docker installed, you can run the platform locally with the following command:
```sh
reshapr run
```

You should see a message like this:
```sh
ℹ️  Resolved 'latest' to release '0.0.8'.
ℹ️  Downloading compose file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reshaprio/reshapr/refs/tags/0.0.8/install/docker-compose-all-in-one.yml...
✅ Compose file saved to /Users/<you>/.reshapr/docker-compose-0.0.8.yml
ℹ️  Starting Reshapr containers (release: 0.0.8)...
✅ Reshapr containers started successfully.
```

Connect to the control plane at http://localhost:5555 with default credentials (`admin/password`):
```sh
reshapr login -s http://localhost:5555 -u admin -p password
```

Import an OpenAPI file:
```sh
reshapr import -u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/refs/heads/main/openapi.yml \
  --backendEndpoint https://api.open-meteo.com
```

You now have a fully functional MCP Server powered by reShapr at http://localhost:7777/mcp/reshapr/Open-Meteo+APIs/1.0 🎉

You can try it out using an MCP client, [explore the CLI](https://reshapr.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started) and 
[more features](https://reshapr.io/docs/references/features)!
